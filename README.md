# Genesis-Fix-V5
I made several errors, in my last version of the fix for genesis.
 
Fixes
Fixed the genesis_rr text file it now updates every time you reopen in it causing less stress on your RAM
Fixed blue screening when running for more then 2 hours
Fixed the base64 pdf in \Genesis-RR-Mod-main\Genesis\x64\Release 
Fixed the lattency while using it!

Added
Now added binds for Time Stop (must run genesis_rr_fix as admin for it to work)
Added a Photon Host option!

Fixed - Mod that works for Rec Room Fixed - by Delinquent, if you have any issues contact me on Discord Nvm#1871.

Instructions

Turn off Windows Defender, run genesis_rr_fix then open Rec Room. Open your watches settings in game and a new tab called Genesis V5 should be there.

If it did not work try Re Running genesis_rr_fix as admin.
